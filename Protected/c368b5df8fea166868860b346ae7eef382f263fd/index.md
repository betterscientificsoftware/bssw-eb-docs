### Password Protected Content Here

There are two rules for success:

1. Never tell everything you know.
1. &nbsp;

### Notes

This uses a very simple password protection scheme based on hashing a
secret code and storing the protected content in a folder of that hash.

If the *repository* itself is private, no visiter can go look at the
content there and so this portion of the site can be kept private if
desired.

This is NOT MY DESIGN. I found the code for this
[here](https://github.com/matteobrusa/Password-protection-for-static-pages).
It is Apache-2.0 Licensed and so I decided to demonstrate its use.`
